# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

A comprehensive data science project focused on analyzing hotel booking data to predict cancellations and no-shows. By leveraging machine learning and advanced analytics, this project helps hotels mitigate revenue losses, improve operational efficiency, and enhance guest satisfaction through predictive insights.

The project analyzes 27,500 booking records across three hotel types (Airport Hotels, Resorts, and City Hotels) to forecast reservation outcomes and identify key factors influencing guest behavior.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Hotels face significant challenges with unpredictable cancellations and no-shows, resulting in:
- **Revenue Loss**: Vacant rooms lead to direct financial impact
- **Operational Inefficiency**: Poor resource allocation for staffing and services  
- **Customer Experience**: Reduced loyalty due to suboptimal service planning

This project addresses these challenges by developing a predictive analytics solution that enables proactive decision-making.

### Key Features
- **Guest Demographics**: Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Educational Level, Income
- **Reservation Details**: Check-in/out dates, Booking date, Room type, Meal type
- **Booking Behavior**: Previous visits, Cancellations, Deposit type, Booking channel
- **Hotel Information**: Hotel type, Country/region, Parking requirements
- **Pricing**: Room rate, Discount rate, Promotion usage

### Target Variable
- **Reservation_Status**: Multi-class target with three outcomes:
  - Check-out (completed stay)
  - Canceled (booking canceled)
  - No-show (failed to arrive)

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Insights & Applications

The SHAP analysis reveals which factors most significantly impact booking outcomes, enabling hotels to:
- **Optimize Pricing Strategies**: Based on cancellation risk factors
- **Improve Resource Planning**: Anticipate no-shows for better staffing
- **Enhance Customer Targeting**: Focus retention efforts on high-risk segments
- **Develop Intervention Programs**: Proactive measures for at-risk bookings
